# RPi-camera-glasses
This project was prompted by GPT-4's visual input feature, which allows image upload and analysis: https://openai.com/product/gpt-4. I will be attaching a Raspberry Pi camera module onto my glasses, capturing images with a button wired to the Pi, and sending those images via an API request to the GPT-4 model (once that feature is available).
